A Static Website  is displayed in a web browser exactly as it is stored. It contains web pages with fixed content coded in HTML and stored on a web server. It does not change, it stays the same, or "static" for every viewer of the site.
A dynamic web page is a web page constructed at runtime (during software execution), as opposed to a static web page, delivered as it is stored. A server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server processing server-side scripts.
